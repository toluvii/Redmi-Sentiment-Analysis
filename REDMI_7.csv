Another Midrange killer Smartphe by Xiaomi,Rishikumar Thakur,4,1,10/1/2018,Display,"Another Midrange killer Smartphe by Xiaomi

Major Highlights:
• The Redmi 6 Pro sports a 5.84-inch full-HD+ display with a notch
• Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdrag 625 SoC
• The phe is priced at Rs. 10,999 for the 3GB RAM variant (Start Point)
• Battery of 4090 mAh and its Durability
• The Tripple Slots
• Dual AI Camera

Well in Redmi 6 Series you will get 3 Different Smartphes with different specs, and from all of them, Redmi 6 pro is most powerful and advanced (as said by Redmi India in their launch event).

Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro design:
Being the most premium phe of the new Redmi 6 family, the Redmi 6 Pro has been given somewhat better materials, in the form of a metal backplate. However, the overall design isn’t too different from what we’ve already seen from Xiaomi at around this price point. This is a fairly thick phe, and it's a bit hefty too, but it’s manageable. The butts have good feedback without being noisy, and  the left side, you get a single tray which can hold two SIM cards and a separate microSD card. Something worth noting is that the Redmi 6 Pro does not support dual 4G VoLTE, which means that ly e SIM can cnect to a 4G network at a time, The placement of ports is good. The mo speaker is  the bottom right, so chances of blocking it when using the phe in landscape mode are slim. The headphe socket is placed  the top, and you also get an infrared (IR) emitter which can be used to ctrol IR appliances through the Mi Remote app.

Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro specificatis and software:
The phe uses Qualcomm’s Snapdrag 625 SoC, which is a couple of years old now but is still a capable chip for general tasks. Gaming performance isn’t great, as some popular games like PUBG, and asphalt default to the lowest graphics settings, and even then, gameplay isn’t smooth. Our unit was running  a pre-release versi of its MIUI software, which prevented us from running most benchmarks.

Storage Optis:
Well I am impressed with the Xiaomi as they provided triple Slot in sim tray (2 for nano sim & e for SD card)

Heating Issues:
Well, I do not find any heating issues in this phe while playing games like PubG and Asphalt.

Camera in Redmi 6 pro:
The rear 12-megapixel camera has a f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There’s auto-HDR, which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn't able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back  track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of secds in daylight. I would be very happy if they have provided the Flash in Portrait Mode, still, you can Tap  Torch ic to switch,  the torch, you will get the flash in Portrait Mode.

Battery in Redmi 6 Pro:
Battery life is e of the strg suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4090mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more  e charge. Playing heavy games didn't drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zero
Well before buying this phe I have heard many issues regarding inbuilt Advertisement in Xiaomi devices, and I checked that too in my previous Xiaomi phe which I am using since 2 Years. And actually, I found inbuilt ads in those phes. You will see ads in inbuilt developers apps like MI Apps, Mi Music, Mi Videos, Security, File Manager, Themes, sometimes you will see full-screen ads which are really irritating for Mi Fans, but there is a cooler way to stop those ads those who wanted to know ctact me.

Final Verdict:
Well for the people who want a notch Display, Big Battery and Descent Camera you they can buy this phe blindly.
Suggesti for Xiaomi India: You should stop those inbuilt Ads present in your devices because we customers d’t find those ads Valuable. Because we are not Surfing any website where many ads are present. So please stop it.

Worst frt camera  a Mi device till date.,Ram Rajkishore,1,0,9/15/18,Camera,It has a worst frt camera I have ever seen  a Mi device.Its just disgusting to see such a poor frt camera  a Rs.11090 device.Very much disappointed.,
Look some other optis guys.... It's just a crap.,Shubham jaishwal,1,0,9/15/18,Display,"Guys, just d't buy Redmi 6 pro for now atleast. Got it delivered yesterday, I have both Gold and Black Variant. Black looks nice. But wait, It's just an unpolished product. The Pinch to fill the video doesn't work in Mi Video app. The left edge remains like this ""|"" and right "")"" even this happens in Youtube. Both apps leave way too much  both sides if I let it to original. Making it a 5 inch screen display. There is No Indian City name in Time Ze, it's shown as GMT+5:30. It automatically detects the time ze as China. Why?? Has to change time, manually!!!! Then, How the heck they say that this is Made in India. While setting up the phe, the Limitless theme has Ics written in chinese. The camera app is incsistent. The so called AI doesn't seem to be going well with SD625. My friend has RN5 pro. I think they both have same app. But his camera shows ic within screen top as if its going to shoot it with Flash or HDR. But, no this is just a crap..

So, a 5.84 screen display is just a waste if I cann't watch video to its limit. What's the purpose served by notch then and what am I supposed to do with that 5.84 inch screen???? No more notificati ics in the notificati bar, No more cnecti speed and battery percentage too, until you drop that notificati panel. Stupid MI !!!!",

Its a OK Phe,D.C.Padhi,3,1,10/15/18,Battery,"Redmi Note4, Note5, now 6pro..It seems the older the model the better was the performance as I used all 3 models in the line. The notch design, hides the battery % and network speed, e has to pull down a bit to see these 2 things. Note 5 and 6pro both have a comm issue-- after switching the swipe up (to unlock) does not work smoothly every time. The escape is to switch off the swipe up feature. After Note4, in the newer models the length of USB cable has become shorter, whichis a problem if you are little away from the plug point. How much cost does Xiaomi saves by shortening the cable? 6pro came with a smaller ejecti tool, additial cost saving by cutting 2gm of metal. The frt flash if Note5 has been removed in 6pro. These manufacturers seem to be idiots and fooling public by launching new models without any real additial feature or improvement. Anyway, its an OK phe for 10,090 (3GB/32GB). For 11,090 a customer expects a little more, and Xiaomi disappoints here.",

#Horrible experience of Redmi 6pro - Read to know more##,Bhaskar Shanmugam,1,0,9/17/18,Camera,"Please d't buy!!

Horrible phe from Xiaomi!!

The phe is just for people who like showing off the new iPhe notch design. The phe uses an outdated processor and lags terrible in term of performance. When we use more than 4apps at a time, the phe will get hanged and you will be forced to restart the phe. Watching videos for more than 20mins the phe gets extrmely heated and you will have to put it to stanby fir a while before resarting the use of the phe. Very bad multi-tasking. The build quality is okay, but not as good as other budget phe. A flat drop  the frt screen side if hit hardly will crack the screen. The frt camera is extremely poor and has been downgraded and doesn't produce even a decent quality picture. Selfie lovers, please d't even buy this phe you will get a heart ache after looking at your pix. The rear camera picture quality is average and is very unlike of xiaomi.

 the other side, the basic things like the output from the speaker phe and and the earphe are extremely poor and distorted...

The ly c is a decent screen, however that is ctributed by low quality video while played in amaz or netflix..

Had complained to Amaz  the above low quality issues, unfortunately Amaz is not willing to listen, they are saying technically the phe is working and hence it can't taken back.. Unfortunately, in this case Amaz has put its sellers over it buyers who are their bread and butter. Hope Amaz listens to my complaint here and takes measures to improve their service... Just to put things into perspective, an average 6-7k phe is sold at an extremely abnoxiously at a high price of 11k. You can find many better phe at this high price. Please stop buying this phe. Thanks for reading. Extremely sadened  buying this phe...",10 people found this helpful

Design can be better,Rahul Mhatre,3,1,9/2/18,Others,The product is great with quite good features. I am great fan of xiaomi and I have been always using Xiaomi phes. But I am disappointed with mobile designing of Xiaomi as most of all the lower range and mid range phes have same design. Xiaomi always being giving with so many features but being realme entering in market Xiaomi has to be more creative to attract more indian customers.,e pers found this helpful

A compact power pack Device with great battery and a decent camera,kunal Sethi,5,1,10/20/18,Display,"This device feels great in hand because it is compact enough and doesn't feels bulky at all. Thanks to its notch display and 19:9 aspect ratio.
Directly coming to its pros and cs after 1 day of use. (will update so)
Pros
1. Design - Compact design as compared to redmi note 5 pro. 5.84"" screen looks way too compact as compared to 6"" in note 5 pro. Design 9/10
2. Rear Camera - Rear Camera is fair enough. If note 5 pro is 20 then it's 19. It captures detailed image in good lights but struggles a bit in low light. Rating 8/10.
3. Audio 9/10
4. Looks like a typical Xiaomi Device. Still ok because it is having unibody metal design 8.5/10.
5. Price - Price of this device is fair in all aspects. 10/10

Cs
The ly c I felt is frt camera. If the camera would be at least 12 MP shooter then this deal would be great or I must say greatest.

For people who are cfused between realme 2 and redmi 6 pro I would suggest them to buy redmi 6 pro.

UNBOXING AND CAMERA SHOTS!,TECHBORED! Himanshu Chatra,5,1,10/22/18,Display,"Hey guys this is TECHBORED! and this is unboxing and also will adding some camera shots.
-----------------------
IN THE BOX
-----------------------
1. Manuals with warranty informati.
2. Charging cable.
3. 5V 2A power adapter.
4. Transparent TPU case.
5. Redmi 6 Pro.
----------
DESIGN
----------
1. The transparent case fits well and is a perfect fit. Gives nice feel in hands.
2. It comes with a notch that is small and I really liked it, At least Xiaomi has tried to cut out the bezels at this budget segment.
3. It sports a FULL HD + display with that 19:9 aspect ratio.
4.  the top of the phe there is this infrared sensor secdary noise cancellati microphe and wow there is this 3.5mm headphe jack. Always happy to see this port.
5. Now moving to the butt than there is this micro USB port situated with microphe and the speaker that is loud but decent sounding speaker.
6. Redmi 6 Pro body is made up of both metal and plastic. So this is ly where metal is used but  the top bottom and  the sides it is plastic. Also the sim tray is made up of plastic. Butts are made up of metal thats nice and gives very nice feedback.
----------------------------
DUAL 4G STANDBY
----------------------------
There is DUAL SIM with dual 4G standby so you can use both sims  4G at same time. And here is a
good thing that I liked about this and it is that it has dedicated Micro SD card slot.
---------------------------
FACE UNLOCK
---------------------------
There is also the finger print sensor that is fast enough to unlock and it also come with this face unlock that is pretty fast and I think it is very much secure. At least it will not be unlocked with your pictures.
-----------------------
CAMERA SETUP
-----------------------
1. The best thing that Xiaomi has put in to this Redmi 6 Pro and it is the same camera setup as  Redmi Note 5 Pro. So it has 12Mp with 5mp dual camera setup with aperture of 2.2 and the single LED flash in the middle. Just now I cannot tell in detail that how how camera performs but I have included some shots that are taken  Redmi 6 Pro and I think they are nice, decent and are almost the the same as  Redmi Note 5 Pro.
2. This camera setup can record upto 1080p videos at 30fps and it supports EIS and the videos are not much shaky and EIS performs well. Where as  the frt is 5MP with aperture of 2.0 camera and its decent.
-------------------
HARDWARE
-------------------
1. So it is powered with the same old Snaprdrag 625 and I think think that it is good for the budget smartphes for now and it performs well  this smartphe.
2. Redmi 6 Pro is backed up with 4090mAh battery that is great.
3. Running  Android 8.1 Oreo and  the top of that there is custom MIUI 9. It will so get a stable update of MIUI10.
4. So the Redmi 6 pro comes in 3GB RAM with 32GB internal mermory and 4GB RAM with 64 GB internal memory variants.",

here i analyse some pros and cs of this phe after countinious using of this phe.
PROS:-
1.screen resoluti is preety good 1080 x 2280 pixels, colours ctrast also very impressive.
2.two days battery backup if you not playing heavy games  it like PUBG.
3.Snapdrag 625 is old but till now it's performance is awsm ,you did not face any lag in games in low graphic setting.
4.camera pictures quality is good, also portrait mode captures the good depth effect in photos but ly in Day light cditi in night you will face high noice in pictures
5.frt facing camera also have AI depth effect it not too much good but you can take good selfy in day light cditi.
6.process optimizati in this phe is good.
7.there are a little notch which increase the looks and design of phe.
CS:-
1.e thing i hate in this phe is its notifacti bar, you will not get all notificati  top bar, every time you need to scroll down the ntificati bar to see app notificatis. net speed meter is also not shown and no whatsapp ic notificati  the top of the bar. because of the notch  the screen.

3. video recording quality of this phe is not good.
4.ly 5MP frt facing camera and quality is very average. in this price segment there are many phes avilabe which have better frt cameras.",

Value for Mey,Amaz Customer,5,1,9/28/18,Display,"Redmi has always have been the the king of budget segment.And yet another they gave us the Redmi 6 pro.It's a beautifully designed,strg and durable.And the camera is awesome just like the Note 5 pro,Display is crisp and the notch is in good shape, means it does take whole screen.Sound quality is clear and loud.But the headset experience is awesome.The Battery is 4090mah which is crazily optimized.In heavy useage it will give 2 day and a half in normal useage it give 3 days.And best thing is the inbuild Mi sercurity which loaded with features.You d't need third security apps.And the phe do charge little faster  it's stock adapter.Atleast 2hrs and 45mins.As it's a Qualcomm Chipset.

Verdict: The Base model is actually the Value for mey deal. 3/32 GB.
I have been using the Redmi 6 pro for 3 weeks now. This is totally tested.",2 people found this helpful
Redmi 6 pro (3/32 GB) review after using for e week.,Arun Yajurvedi,3,1,9/28/18,Display,"Over prised by at least around Rs.1090/- Low light photos are bad. ly e SIM support VOLTE.
Good things are best sound, good display, smooth touch, excellent battery life management, compact, nice photos and videos under good light. It never gets over heated while using or charging. I d't play games. I like MIUI. I have already Redmi 4 A (Rs.6090/-ly) using for more than 14 mths working superbly. I have good opini about Redmi mobiles.",2 people found this helpful
